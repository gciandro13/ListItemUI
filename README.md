# ListItemUI
This is a first WPF / MVVM application experiment, that allows user edit / add/ delete items in a List.
I follow the pattern Model - View - ViewModel, trying to separate concerns that belong to different responsability.

Experiment with : 
- Pattern MVVM (Model -  View- ViewModel)
- TDD (Test Driven Development)
